It is a way to create a high-level view of a system that allows users to interact with it without having to understand the underlying details of how it works. In OOP, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes, interfaces, and other mechanisms that allow developers to define common behaviors and characteristics for a group of objects without having to implement them directly.\n",

It is a way to protect data and prevent unauthorized access or modification by hiding the implementation details from the outside world. Encapsulation is achieved in OOP by defining class properties and methods with different levels of visibility, such as public, private, and protected, and providing access to them through well-defined interfaces.\n",
